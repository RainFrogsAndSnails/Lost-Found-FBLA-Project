**Pictures,Files, And More!**

- This part of the README.md file will go over any files, pictures, and code that may be copyrighted or down right copied/used.
- Please note that I am using ChatGPT to judge my work and to help me with my schedule on learning the required skills for this project.
- The Social Preview for the repository is my own design. <https://github.com/RainFrogsAndSnails/Lost-Found-FBLA-Project>
- - Social Preview is only visable through sending the repository link through social media and hovering over the link. Therefore, it is not visible in this README.md file.
