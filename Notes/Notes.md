**Contrast Ratio**:

- 7:1 contrast is the top notch standard for accessibility. -- AAA standard
- 21:1 contrast is the highest possible contrast ratio, achieved by pure black and pure w.hite. -- AAA standard and higher
You can acquire the required contrast ratio by altering hue, saturation, and the light values of the colors.

***Visual Hierarchical***

Using changing sizes in the headings and text can help create a distinct visual heirarchy in the page.

- Callout boxes can be used to draw attention to a specific section of the page.
- You can also use the callout boxes to add a visual button of importance other wise known as a CTA (Call to Action).
- Scaling is also important! Using scaling can help create a path for the user/reader to follow and can also help create a visual hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is important as it conveys other components like the navigation bar.
